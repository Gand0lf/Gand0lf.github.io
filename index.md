# The Journey begins, at last

## Intro

Frankly, life has done it's best at throwing me the occasional bone to get started coding. With a tendency to delve into any kind of editor, modular setup (yes, maybe Lego) and videogames one might claim I should have seen it coming. Well, I haven't.

A banker by profession and economist by education I am, at heart, a nerdy hobby cook, trying to find a way through the thicket that is life. Only recently, I found that coding and in particular following the open source pilgrim's path not only helps to get too bored at work but truly adds value to the people around you in many ways.

This blog merely intents to describe the stages of this ongoing journey.
