## A little note on my vim setup

It must have been roughly 3 years, back in Barcelona, when I saw a former classmate of mine using *emacs*. The speed at which the code on his terminal changed was amazing and genuinely unseend for me, who at that time spent the better part of my computer time in IDEs such as Matlab and R Studio. 

Fast forward to the beginning of 2020, where, after a mostly work related journey in Python and Java, I finally forced myself to look into VIM[^1]. Why not emacs? Gut feeling, really.

## Code

General preformatted text:

    # Do a thing
    do_thing()

Python code and output:

```python
# Prints '2'
print(1+1)
```



[^1]: In python I work in jupyter+vim (using autoreload 2 cell magic and setup.py + pip -e installed package) or PyCharm. In Java I resort to IntelliJ.
